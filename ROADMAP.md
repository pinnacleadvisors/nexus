## Phase 11 — Multi-Agent Orchestration (Complete)

> Inspired by [ruvnet/ruflo](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo). Architecture: **Queen agents** coordinate swarms of specialist agents. A `StrategicQueen` breaks goals into phases, a `TacticalQueen` assigns tasks to specialists, an `AdaptiveQueen` monitors for drift. All decisions go through a configurable consensus layer.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ✅ | **Swarm kernel** — `lib/swarm/`: `Queen.ts`, `Consensus.ts`, `Router.ts`, `ReasoningBank.ts`, `TokenOptimiser.ts`, `WasmFastPath.ts`, `index.ts` |

| ✅ | **Consensus layer** — Raft (simple majority, default), BFT (strict 2/3 with confidence weighting, for finance/legal), Gossip (fast-accept for content tasks) |
| ✅ | **Intelligent router** — Q-Learning router (`lib/swarm/Router.ts`); ε-greedy exploration; reward = quality / normalised token cost; routing decisions saved to ReasoningBank |
| ✅ | **ReasoningBank** — `supabase/migrations/006_swarm.sql` `reasoning_patterns` table; stores task_type, agent_role, model, result_quality, tokens_used; in-memory fallback when Supabase unconfigured |
| ✅ | **WASM fast-path** — `lib/swarm/WasmFastPath.ts` JS implementation of 6 transforms (format-json, extract-urls, normalise, word-count, parse-date, strip-markdown) at zero LLM cost |
| ✅ | **Token optimiser** — `lib/swarm/TokenOptimiser.ts`; whitespace normalisation, paragraph deduplication, code block compression, smart truncation; target 12k token context |
| ✅ | **Swarm API** — `POST /api/swarm/dispatch` (SSE stream, X-Swarm-Id header); `GET /api/swarm/:id` (state + tasks); `DELETE /api/swarm/:id` (abort) |
| ✅ | **Swarm UI** — `/swarm` page with goal/context input, queen/consensus/budget settings, real-time event log, phase/task progress cards, synthesis output |
| ✅ | **MCP server** — `lib/swarm/mcp.ts` tool definitions; served at `GET/POST /api/swarm/mcp/:tool`; tools: `create_swarm`, `get_swarm_status`, `abort_swarm`, `list_agents` |
| ✅ | **Drift prevention** — AdaptiveQueen checks alignment at every N tasks; re-emits `drift` event when swarm diverges from goal |
| ✅ | **Fault tolerance** — per-task error isolation; failed tasks don't block phase; all failures written to audit log; budget cap enforced per phase |

### Implementation details
- `lib/swarm/Queen.ts` — `strategicDecompose()` uses Opus; `tacticalAssign()` uses Router; `executeTask()` runs fast-path → LLM → consensus pipeline; `runSwarm()` orchestrates phases
- `supabase/migrations/006_swarm.sql` — `swarm_runs`, `swarm_tasks`, `reasoning_patterns` tables; Realtime enabled
- `lib/database.types.ts` — updated with all 3 new tables

## Phase 12 — Tribe v2: Neuro-Optimised Content Engine ✅ Complete

> Content creation informed by cognitive neuroscience: dopamine anticipation loops, curiosity gaps, social proof triggers, novelty detection, and narrative tension arcs — proven to increase engagement and memorability.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ✅ | **Neuro-content library** — `lib/neuro-content/` with types, 12 principles, 8 format templates, 5 tone profiles; scoring + revision prompt builders; full re-export via index |
| ✅ | **Neuro-content agent** — new `'neuro-content'` capability in `lib/agent-capabilities.ts`; system prompt encodes all 12 cognitive engagement principles with application guidance |
| ✅ | **Content scoring API** — `POST /api/content/score` scores text against all 12 principles using Claude Sonnet; returns `ContentScore` with per-principle scores (0–100), overall score, grade (A–F), topStrengths, topWeaknesses, and 3 concrete suggestions |
| ✅ | **Revision loop** — `POST /api/content/generate` generates draft → scores with Claude Haiku (fast) → if score < `targetScore`, rewrites targeting the weakest principles → up to 3 iterations; returns `X-Neuro-Score`, `X-Neuro-Grade`, `X-Neuro-Iterations` headers |
| ✅ | **Format templates** — 8 formats: LinkedIn post, X/Twitter thread, Instagram caption, long-form blog, cold email, landing page hero, VSL script, YouTube description; each with structure blueprint, format-specific neuro guidelines, and a structural example |
| ✅ | **Tribe tone profiles** — 5 profiles: authority (declarative, data-backed), peer (warm, conversational), challenger (provocative, counterintuitive), storyteller (narrative-driven, sensory), data-driven (precise, evidence-first); each with voice paragraph, do/don't lists, sample phrase |
| ✅ | **A/B variant generator** — `POST /api/content/variants` produces 3 variants in parallel, each emphasising a different trigger: curiosity gap, loss aversion, social proof; side-by-side in UI with copy buttons |
| ✅ | **Tribe v2 UI** — `app/(protected)/tools/content/page.tsx`; format picker (dropdown), tone picker (pill buttons), topic/context inputs, target score slider, generate button, streaming output, score panel with 12 principle bars (expandable), variant tabs; "Content" added to sidebar (Sparkles icon) |
| ⬜ | **Content analytics** — connect published content performance (CTR, time-on-page, shares) back to neuro score; surface correlation on dashboard to improve future scoring weights |
| ⬜ | **muapi.ai media pairing** — after content is generated, automatically call muapi.ai to generate a matching image/visual; result attached to board card and uploaded to R2/Supabase Storage |

### Implementation Notes
- `lib/neuro-content/types.ts` — all TypeScript interfaces: `NeuroPrinciple`, `PrincipleScore`, `ContentScore`, `FormatTemplate`, `ToneProfile`, `GenerateContentRequest`, `ContentVariant`, `VariantsResponse`
- `lib/neuro-content/principles.ts` — 12 `NeuroPrinciple` objects + `buildScoringPrompt()` + `buildRevisionPrompt()`
- `lib/neuro-content/templates.ts` — 8 `FormatTemplate` objects + `getTemplate()` helper
- `lib/neuro-content/tones.ts` — 5 `ToneProfile` objects + `getToneProfile()` helper
- Scoring uses Claude Sonnet 4.6 for quality, Claude Haiku for fast revision-loop scoring
- Rate limits: score 20/min, generate 10/min, variants 5/min (expensive — 3 parallel Sonnet calls)

### Reference
- Tribe v2 philosophy: content is a neurological event before it is a marketing event — engineer for brain state first, message second.

| ⬜ | **Workflow gap analysis** — identifies which steps can be automated via n8n, which require OpenClaw, and which are manual; produces a gap report saved to Notion and displayed in Forge |
| ⬜ | **Recommendation cards** — each recommendation auto-creates a Board card in Backlog with: tool name, workflow description, estimated setup time, required credentials |

### 13b — n8n Workflow Generation

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **n8n blueprint generator** — `POST /api/n8n/generate` accepts a workflow description and outputs a valid n8n JSON workflow file (compatible with n8n v1+ import format) |
| ⬜ | **Workflow templates** — pre-built blueprint library: social post scheduler, lead capture → CRM, invoice generation, content republishing pipeline, competitor monitoring, onboarding email sequence, support ticket routing, analytics digest |
| ⬜ | **muapi.ai node** — custom n8n HTTP node configuration for muapi.ai; generates images/video/audio assets as part of content workflows; credentials stored in n8n credential store (not Doppler) |
| ⬜ | **Setup checklist generation** — for each workflow blueprint, consultant generates a human-readable checklist of: accounts to create, API keys to obtain, OAuth connections to authorise, n8n credentials to configure; list is saved to Notion + added to Board as sequential Backlog cards |
| ⬜ | **n8n webhook receiver** — `POST /api/webhooks/n8n` receives workflow completion events; parses payload, updates relevant Board card status, appends result to Notion |
| ⬜ | **Workflow status page** — `/tools/n8n` shows all active n8n workflows, last run status, next scheduled run, and a "trigger now" button |

### 13c — OpenClaw Fallback Bridge

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **API gap detection** — consultant flags any workflow step that cannot be accomplished via a public API (e.g. scraping, browser automation, actions requiring 2FA); these steps are automatically dispatched to OpenClaw |
| ⬜ | **Hybrid workflow** — n8n handles API-native steps → OpenClaw handles browser/scraping steps → result flows back into n8n via webhook; orchestrated from `/api/swarm/dispatch` |
| ⬜ | **Priority routing rule** — Consultant agent always checks n8n first; only escalates to OpenClaw when n8n cannot accomplish the task natively |

### Manual Steps — n8n
- [ ] Deploy n8n: self-hosted (`docker run n8nio/n8n`) or n8n Cloud (https://n8n.io/cloud/)
- [ ] Add `N8N_BASE_URL` to Doppler — your n8n instance URL (e.g. `https://n8n.yourdomain.com`)
- [ ] Add `N8N_API_KEY` to Doppler — n8n Settings → API → Create API Key
- [ ] Register Nexus webhook in n8n: URL = `https://<your-vercel-domain>/api/webhooks/n8n`
- [ ] Add `MUAPI_AI_KEY` to Doppler — register at https://muapi.ai → API Keys
- [ ] Import starter workflow blueprints from `/tools/n8n` after Phase 13b is deployed

## Phase 14 — 3D Relational Knowledge Graph (Not Started)

> A live 3D graph where every business, project, milestone, agent, tool, workflow, and code repository is a node. Edges show relationships: "project uses tool", "agent created asset", "milestone depends on milestone", "workflow triggers agent". Agents query the graph via a lightweight API to get full relational context in a single call — inspired by Graphify's 71x token reduction and GitNexus's precomputed relational intelligence.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **Graph data model** — `lib/graph/types.ts`: `GraphNode` (id, type, label, metadata, position3d), `GraphEdge` (source, target, relation, weight, createdAt); node types: `business`, `project`, `milestone`, `agent`, `tool`, `workflow`, `repository`, `asset`, `prompt`, `skill` |
| ⬜ | **Graph builder** — `lib/graph/builder.ts`: queries Supabase for all entities and relationships; constructs in-memory graph; runs Leiden community detection to assign cluster IDs; exports `graph.json`; incremental update on entity change |
| ⬜ | **Graph API** — `GET /api/graph` returns full serialised graph; `GET /api/graph/node/:id` returns node + 1-hop neighbourhood; `GET /api/graph/path?from=&to=` returns shortest path; `POST /api/graph/query` accepts natural language query, returns subgraph |
| ⬜ | **3D renderer** — `/graph` page using `react-three-fiber` + `@react-three/drei`; nodes rendered as glowing spheres sized by PageRank score; edges as lines with opacity proportional to relationship strength; clusters occupy distinct 3D regions; camera orbit/zoom/pan |
| ⬜ | **Node type visual encoding** — businesses: gold, projects: indigo, milestones: teal, agents: purple, tools: grey, workflows: orange, repos: green, assets: pink; node size = connection count; edge colour = relation type |
| ⬜ | **Agent context API** — `POST /api/graph/context` accepts a task description; returns the minimal subgraph of relevant nodes (cosine similarity on node embeddings); agents call this before starting any task to get relational context without scanning all files |
| ⬜ | **MCP tool exposure** — `get_graph_context(task_description)` MCP tool so OpenClaw and Claude Code can call it natively; returns JSON subgraph of ≤20 nodes; target: 50–70x token reduction vs raw file scanning (per Graphify benchmarks) |
| ⬜ | **Search + filter panel** — sidebar on `/graph` with text search, node type filter, relationship filter, time-range slider; matching nodes pulse in the 3D view |
| ⬜ | **Temporal replay** — scrub through time to see how the graph grew: each node appears at its `createdAt` timestamp; reveals growth patterns and bottlenecks |
| ⬜ | **Auto-layout modes** — force-directed (default), hierarchical (org-chart), radial (business-centric), cluster-grid; toggle in UI |
| ⬜ | **Embed in Forge / Dashboard** — minimap 2D projection of the graph shown in Forge sidebar; clicking a node deep-links to the relevant project or tool |

### Technical approach
- **Renderer**: `react-three-fiber` + `@react-three/drei` + `three.js` (already a transitive dep) — no new rendering engine needed
- **Graph computation**: `graphology` + `graphology-communities-louvain` (JS-native, no Python); runs server-side at build/refresh time
- **Embeddings**: Supabase `pgvector` + `text-embedding-3-small` (OpenAI) or Anthropic's embedding endpoint for `POST /api/graph/context`
- **Performance**: graph snapshot cached in Redis/Supabase, rebuilt on entity mutation; 3D scene uses instanced meshes for up to 10,000 nodes at 60 fps

## Phase 15 — Library Layer & Token Efficiency (Not Started)

> A structured, searchable store of reusable building blocks — code functions, agent configs, prompt templates, and skill definitions. Agents query the library before writing anything new, dramatically reducing duplicate generation and per-task token spend.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **Database schema** — migration `006_libraries.sql`: tables `code_snippets`, `agent_templates`, `prompt_templates`, `skill_definitions`; all with `embedding vector(1536)`, `tags text[]`, `usage_count int`, `avg_quality_score float` |
| ⬜ | **Code function library** — `/tools/library/code`: stores reusable TypeScript/Python/SQL snippets; each tagged with language, purpose, dependencies; agents call `GET /api/library/code?q=` before generating boilerplate |
| ⬜ | **Agent template library** — `/tools/library/agents`: stores agent system prompt blueprints (role, constraints, output format, example); versioned; consultant agent uses this to spawn specialist agents without re-writing prompts |
| ⬜ | **Prompt library** — `/tools/library/prompts`: curated prompt templates for common tasks; each template has fill-in variables, neuro-optimisation score, and usage analytics; agents retrieve best-scoring template for task type |
| ⬜ | **Skill definitions library** — `/tools/library/skills`: structured skill definitions compatible with MCP tool format; agents check this library before requesting new OpenClaw skills |
| ⬜ | **Semantic search** — `POST /api/library/search?type=code|agent|prompt|skill&q=` does pgvector cosine similarity search; returns top-5 matches with similarity score; embedded at task start in every swarm run |
| ⬜ | **Auto-population** — after every completed agent run: extract reusable fragments (functions, prompts, patterns) via a post-processing agent; auto-add to library with quality score derived from user approval |
| ⬜ | **Library UI** — `/tools/library` with tabbed interface (Code / Agents / Prompts / Skills); search bar, tag filter, usage stats, copy button, "use in Forge" button |
| ⬜ | **Token savings tracker** — dashboard widget showing estimated tokens saved this week via library hits vs cold generation; motivates curation |

---

## Phase 16 — Organisation Chart & Agent Hierarchy (Not Started)

> A live org chart showing the full hierarchy of agents active in Nexus: who spawned whom, which queen is coordinating which specialists, what each layer is currently doing, and the accountability chain back to the user.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **Agent hierarchy model** — extend `agents` table: add `parent_agent_id`, `layer` (strategic/tactical/operational), `spawned_by`, `swarm_id`; all agent spawning events written to audit log |
| ⬜ | **Org chart page** — `/dashboard/org` renders a top-down tree: User → Strategic Queens → Tactical Queens → Specialist Agents → Background Workers; each node shows current status (idle/running/error), task count, and cost |
| ⬜ | **Layer definitions** — **L0: User** (approves, rejects, redirects); **L1: Strategic Queens** (goal decomposition, phase planning); **L2: Tactical Queens** (task assignment, resource allocation); **L3: Specialist Agents** (execution — coder, researcher, marketer etc.); **L4: Workers** (background jobs — Inngest functions, webhooks) |
| ⬜ | **Real-time updates** — org chart subscribes to Supabase Realtime `agents` channel; spawned agents appear instantly; completed agents dim; errors glow red |
| ⬜ | **Drill-down panel** — click any agent node to see: current task, last 5 actions, tokens used this session, model being used, associated board cards, and a "terminate" button |
| ⬜ | **Swimlane view** — alternative layout grouping agents by business/project rather than by hierarchy; shows cross-project agent sharing |
| ⬜ | **Accountability chain** — every Board card, Notion append, and file commit links back to the agent that created it and the queen that assigned it; visible in card detail view |
| ⬜ | **Agent utilisation chart** — stacked bar chart on dashboard showing agent hours (token-equivalent) by layer; highlights if strategic layer is over-indexing (plan-heavy) or if operational layer is bottlenecked |

---

## Phase 17 — DeerFlow 2.0 Integration (Not Started)

> Deploy ByteDance's open-source SuperAgent harness (58k+ GitHub stars, MIT licence) as a **sidecar microservice** alongside Nexus. DeerFlow 2.0 provides two things Nexus currently lacks: (1) multi-hop live web research with cited sources, and (2) sandboxed code execution in Docker/Kubernetes — reducing or eliminating OpenClaw dependency for coding tasks. Everything else (business management, content engine, auth, billing, approval flow) stays in Nexus.

> **Architecture:** Nexus Swarm (TypeScript) → dispatches research/coding tasks → DeerFlow REST API → returns cited report or verified code → Nexus persists result + creates Board card.

> **ByteDance compliance note:** DeerFlow is MIT-licensed open-source code that you self-host. No data leaves your infrastructure to ByteDance. Formal compliance review is required before deploying in regulated industries (finance, health, government).

### 17a — DeerFlow Deployment

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **Deploy DeerFlow 2.0** — self-hosted on Railway or Render (~$25–50/mo for a 4 vCPU / 8 GB instance); use `make up` (standard mode) or `make up-pro` (Gateway mode, fewer processes); expose on internal network only — no public IP |
| ⬜ | **Environment config** — `make setup` wizard: choose Claude Sonnet 4.6 as LLM, Tavily as search provider, Docker as sandbox mode; store `DEERFLOW_BASE_URL` + `DEERFLOW_API_KEY` in Doppler |
| ⬜ | **Health check** — `GET /health` endpoint; Inngest background job pings every 5 minutes; alerts via Resend if DeerFlow goes down |
| ⬜ | **Sandbox isolation** — DeerFlow's Docker sandbox runs in a separate container network; no access to Nexus's database or secrets; read `make doctor` output to verify |

### 17b — Nexus Integration Layer

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **DeerFlow client** — `lib/deerflow/client.ts`: `submitTask(goal, context)` → POST to DeerFlow Gateway API → returns `{ taskId, streamUrl }`; `pollTask(taskId)` → GET result; `streamTask(taskId)` → SSE reader |
| ⬜ | **Swarm routing hook** — in `lib/swarm/Queen.ts`, `executeTask()` checks task tags: if `researcher` or `coder` and DeerFlow is configured → dispatch to DeerFlow client instead of direct LLM call; falls back to LLM if DeerFlow unreachable |
| ⬜ | **Researcher agent upgrade** — researcher agent in `lib/swarm/agents/registry.ts` gains `useDeerFlow: true` flag; DeerFlow provides multi-hop Tavily search + cited markdown report; citations extracted and stored in `reasoning_patterns` |
| ⬜ | **Coder agent upgrade** — coder agent dispatches to DeerFlow sandbox; DeerFlow writes, runs, and verifies code in Docker container; returns working code + test output; result saved as artifact in Supabase Storage |
| ⬜ | **Cost tracking** — DeerFlow tasks log token usage via `POST /api/token-events`; LLM model + token count extracted from DeerFlow task result metadata; cost estimate added to swarm budget tracking |
| ⬜ | **DeerFlow status page** — `/tools/deerflow`: shows connection status, active tasks, last 10 completed tasks, total tokens used, estimated cost savings vs OpenClaw |

### 17c — Tavily Live Web Search (Quick Win — Do First)

> Tavily can be integrated directly into Nexus's researcher agent without deploying DeerFlow. This closes the live-web-research gap in ~4 hours and can be done independently.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **Install Tavily** — `npm i @tavily/core`; add `TAVILY_API_KEY` to Doppler (free tier: 1,000 searches/mo; pro: $50/mo for 10,000) |
| ⬜ | **Search tool** — `lib/tools/tavily.ts`: `searchWeb(query, maxResults?)` → calls Tavily API → returns `{ title, url, content, score }[]`; auto-truncates to 4,000 tokens |
| ⬜ | **Inject into researcher agent** — researcher system prompt updated: "Before answering, call the `search_web` tool with your research queries. Cite all sources." Tool calling wired via Vercel AI SDK `tools` parameter |
| ⬜ | **Citation rendering** — Board card detail view renders citations as clickable source links; Notion append includes citation list below report |

### Manual Steps — DeerFlow

- [ ] Provision Railway service: `railway up` from the deer-flow repo root, or use Railway GitHub integration
- [ ] Add `DEERFLOW_BASE_URL` to Doppler — internal Railway service URL (e.g. `https://deerflow.internal.railway.app`)
- [ ] Add `TAVILY_API_KEY` to Doppler — register at https://tavily.com → API Keys (do this first; works without DeerFlow)
- [ ] Add `DEERFLOW_API_KEY` to Doppler — set in DeerFlow's `.env` as `API_KEY`, then copy here
- [ ] Verify sandbox: run `make doctor` on the DeerFlow instance; confirm Docker sandbox accessible
- [ ] Set `DEERFLOW_ENABLED=true` in Doppler — gates the routing hook in `lib/swarm/Queen.ts`

### Reference
- DeerFlow 2.0 GitHub: https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow (MIT, 58k+ stars)
- DeerFlow skills DeerFlow can use: web research, slide decks, podcast export, image gen prompts, video gen prompts, data analysis, code execution
- Cost comparison: DeerFlow sidecar (~$25–50/mo infra) vs OpenClaw (Claude Pro subscription ~$20–100/mo) — DeerFlow wins on coding tasks; OpenClaw wins on browser automation + tasks requiring 2FA

## Phase 18 — Video Generation Pipeline (Not Started)

> End-to-end AI video production: Tribe v2 generates the script (already built) → n8n orchestrates the render pipeline → Kling 2.0 / Runway Gen-4 render the video → ElevenLabs adds voiceover → final video stored in R2 and linked to a Board card for approval. Covers both cinematic short-form content and ultra-realistic UGC (talking head / product demo) formats.

> **Key insight:** Neither DeerFlow nor any other agent framework renders video natively. All video AI tools require API integration. The advantage of building this in Nexus is that Tribe v2's neuro-optimised VSL script format (already live) feeds directly into the pipeline — DeerFlow would need to replicate this from scratch.

### 18a — Script-to-Video (Cinematic)

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **Video brief agent** — new agent capability in `lib/agent-capabilities.ts`: accepts topic + format (`cinematic-short` \| `ugc-product` \| `ugc-talking-head` \| `explainer`) → generates structured video brief: scene-by-scene breakdown, shot descriptions, audio cues, on-screen text; saved as Notion page + Board card |
| ⬜ | **Tribe v2 VSL integration** — `/tools/content` gains "Export to Video" button when format = `vsl-script`; sends script to video brief agent; populates scene descriptions from VSL structure |
| ⬜ | **Kling 2.0 integration** — `lib/video/kling.ts`: `generateClip(prompt, referenceImage?, duration?)` → POST to Kling API → polls for completion → returns video URL; supports text-to-video and image-to-video (first/last frame guidance) |
| ⬜ | **Runway Gen-4 integration** — `lib/video/runway.ts`: `generateClip(prompt, style?)` → Runway API; used for cinematic/stylised output where Kling is less suitable; model selected per scene via video brief agent |
| ⬜ | **Scene assembly** — n8n workflow stitches clips: for each scene in brief → call Kling/Runway → collect video files → pass to FFmpeg node (n8n built-in) for concatenation → output final MP4 |
| ⬜ | **Video API route** — `POST /api/video/generate`: accepts video brief JSON → dispatches to n8n workflow → returns `{ jobId, estimatedDuration, estimatedCost }`; `GET /api/video/:jobId` streams progress via SSE |

### 18b — Voiceover & Audio Layer

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **ElevenLabs integration** — `lib/audio/elevenlabs.ts`: `generateVoiceover(script, voiceId, stability?)` → ElevenLabs API → returns MP3; voice cloning optional (upload reference audio); `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in Doppler |
| ⬜ | **Voice profile store** — Supabase table `voice_profiles`: `{ id, name, elevenlabs_voice_id, sample_url, language }`; user selects per-project; agents recall saved voice for consistent brand audio |
| ⬜ | **Background music** — `lib/audio/suno.ts` or `lib/audio/udio.ts`: `generateTrack(mood, duration)` → AI music API → returns MP3; mood inferred from video brief (e.g. "high energy" for product demo, "ambient" for explainer) |
| ⬜ | **Audio mix** — n8n FFmpeg node: voiceover + background music → duck music at -18dB under speech → mixed MP4 |
| ⬜ | **Lip-sync / dubbing** — optional: pass final audio through ElevenLabs dubbing API or D-ID to sync mouth movement if using a talking avatar |

### 18c — UGC Format (Talking Head / Product Demo)

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **HeyGen integration** — `lib/video/heygen.ts`: `generateAvatar(script, avatarId, voiceId)` → HeyGen API → returns video URL; supports 100+ photorealistic avatars + custom avatar upload; `HEYGEN_API_KEY` in Doppler |
| ⬜ | **Avatar library** — `/tools/video/avatars`: browse + preview HeyGen avatar catalogue; user pins 1–3 brand avatars; avatar ID stored in business profile |
| ⬜ | **Product demo mode** — `lib/video/heygen.ts` `generateProductDemo(productImages[], script)` → HeyGen screen-record mode; avatar presents on-screen product walkthrough |
| ⬜ | **D-ID fallback** — `lib/video/did.ts`: cheaper alternative to HeyGen for simple talking-head; `generateTalkingPhoto(imageUrl, audioUrl)` → D-ID API → MP4 |
| ⬜ | **muapi.ai scene images** — `lib/media/muapi.ts`: `generateSceneImage(prompt, style?)` → muapi.ai API → PNG; used as reference frames for Kling image-to-video or as static inserts in the final video; `MUAPI_AI_KEY` in Doppler (planned since Phase 12) |

### 18d — Asset Management & Approval

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **Video storage** — completed MP4s uploaded to Cloudflare R2 (`lib/r2.ts`, already exists); presigned URL returned; thumbnail extracted via FFmpeg and stored alongside |
| ⬜ | **Board card auto-creation** — on video completion, Board card created in Review column: card includes video player (HTML5 `<video>` with presigned URL), script, cost breakdown, platform export links |
| ⬜ | **Video player in Review modal** — `components/board/ReviewModal.tsx` gains video-aware rendering: detects `.mp4` / `.webm` asset URLs → renders inline video player with playback controls |
| ⬜ | **Platform export** — one-click download as: 9:16 (TikTok/Reels/Shorts), 1:1 (Instagram feed), 16:9 (YouTube/LinkedIn); aspect ratio conversion via FFmpeg in n8n workflow |
| ⬜ | **Video dashboard widget** — `/dashboard` gains "Video Production" section: videos in pipeline, avg render time, total cost this month, top-performing format |

### Manual Steps — Video Pipeline

- [ ] Register Kling 2.0 API: https://klingai.com/api → add `KLING_API_KEY` to Doppler
- [ ] Register Runway Gen-4 API: https://runwayml.com → add `RUNWAY_API_KEY` to Doppler
- [ ] Register ElevenLabs: https://elevenlabs.io → add `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` to Doppler
- [ ] Register HeyGen: https://heygen.com → add `HEYGEN_API_KEY` to Doppler (for UGC/avatar videos)
- [ ] Register D-ID: https://d-id.com → add `DID_API_KEY` to Doppler (cheaper talking-head fallback)
- [ ] Register muapi.ai: https://muapi.ai → add `MUAPI_AI_KEY` to Doppler (scene image generation)
- [ ] Optional — Suno or Udio for AI background music: add `SUNO_API_KEY` or `UDIO_API_KEY` to Doppler
- [ ] Ensure FFmpeg available in n8n instance (pre-installed in n8n Docker image)
- [ ] Set R2 CORS policy to allow presigned URL playback from Vercel domain

### Cost Reference (per video, approximate)

| Format | Tools | Estimated Cost |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| 60s cinematic (8 scenes) | Kling 2.0 + ElevenLabs + Suno | ~$2–8 |
| 30s UGC talking head | HeyGen + ElevenLabs | ~$1–3 |
| 90s explainer | Runway Gen-4 + ElevenLabs + muapi.ai | ~$5–15 |
| 3-min product demo | HeyGen enterprise + ElevenLabs | ~$5–10 |

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Quick wins (hours, not days)
1. **Add Tavily web search** — `npm i @tavily/core`; add `TAVILY_API_KEY` to Doppler; inject live search results into the researcher swarm agent in `lib/swarm/agents/registry.ts`. Closes the biggest quality gap vs DeerFlow (~4 hrs)
2. **Configure OpenClaw** at `/tools/claw` → Forge chat goes live using Claude Pro subscription (no API key needed)
3. **Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** in Doppler (optional) → fallback if OpenClaw is unavailable

### Infrastructure (this week)
4. **Set up Supabase** → replace mock data with real agent state
5. **Add Stripe webhook** → real revenue on Dashboard
6. **Implement Notion API** → agents write to knowledge base
7. **Enable Clerk MFA** → security baseline for production use

### Phase 17 fast-track (deploy DeerFlow alongside Nexus)
8. **Deploy DeerFlow 2.0** to Railway ($25/mo) — gives sandboxed bash execution + live multi-hop web research with source citations; integrate via `lib/deerflow/client.ts`; reduces or eliminates OpenClaw dependency for coding tasks
